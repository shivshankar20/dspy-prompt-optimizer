# Customer Service Conversation - Delivery Complaint

**Agent:** Hello, thank you for calling QuickShip Delivery. This is Jennifer speaking. How can I help you?

**Customer:** Hi Jennifer, I'm calling about an order that was supposed to arrive three days ago. I still haven't received it and I'm getting really frustrated.

**Agent:** I sincerely apologize for the delay. I understand how frustrating that must be. Let me look into this for you right away. Can you please provide your order number?

**Customer:** It's QS-447892.

**Agent:** Thank you. Let me pull that up... Okay, I can see your order here. You ordered a birthday gift set on February 15th with guaranteed delivery by February 21st. Is that correct?

**Customer:** Yes, exactly. It was supposed to be a birthday present for my sister, and her birthday was yesterday. Now it's ruined.

**Agent:** I'm truly sorry this happened, especially for such an important occasion. Let me check the tracking information... I can see that the package left our warehouse on time, but there was an unexpected delay at the sorting facility due to severe weather in the Midwest. The package is currently in transit and should arrive tomorrow, February 25th.

**Customer:** Tomorrow? That's still too late. The whole point was to have it for her birthday. This is unacceptable.

**Agent:** You're absolutely right, and I take full responsibility for this. While the weather was beyond our control, we did guarantee delivery and didn't meet that commitment. Here's what I'd like to do to make this right: First, I'll process a full refund for the shipping charges. Second, I'll apply a 25% discount to your order as an apology. And third, I can send you a $30 credit for your next purchase.

**Customer:** Well... I appreciate that, but it doesn't change the fact that I didn't have the gift for her birthday.

**Agent:** I completely understand. Would it help if I also expedited a replacement order at no cost? You could choose a similar item, and I'll ensure it ships today with overnight delivery, so you can still give your sister something special, even if it's a day late?

**Customer:** You can do that?

**Agent:** Absolutely. Since we failed to deliver on our promise, it's the least we can do. You'd receive both orders - you can keep the original for yourself or give it as a second gift, and there will be no additional charge for the replacement.

**Customer:** Okay, that actually would help. The original order was the spa gift set - do you have something similar that's in stock?

**Agent:** Yes! We have the Deluxe Spa Collection which is very similar but includes a few extra items. It's normally $85, but as I mentioned, there will be no charge. Shall I send that to the same address?

**Customer:** Yes, please. And you're sure it will arrive tomorrow?

**Agent:** I'm personally flagging this for overnight shipping, and I'll send you tracking information via email within the hour. You'll have it by end of day tomorrow, guaranteed.

**Customer:** Alright. Thank you for working with me on this. I was really upset, but you've been very helpful.

**Agent:** I completely understand your frustration, and I'm glad we could find a solution. Again, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Customer:** No, that's everything. Thanks again.

**Agent:** You're welcome. Have a great day, and please give our best wishes to your sister!
