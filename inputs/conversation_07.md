# Customer Service Conversation - Hotel Reservation Problem

**Agent:** Hello, Grandview Hotel, this is Mike.

**Customer:** Hi Mike, I have a reservation for tonight under the name Patricia Johnson, but I just received an email saying it was cancelled. I never cancelled it.

**Agent:** Let me check... Yeah, I see it was cancelled yesterday.

**Customer:** But I didn't cancel it. I need that room for tonight. Can you reinstate my reservation?

**Agent:** Sorry, the room's been given to someone else already.

**Customer:** What? How is that possible? I made this reservation three weeks ago and confirmed it last week.

**Agent:** Well, according to our system, it shows cancelled. Nothing I can do about that now.

**Customer:** But I'm driving there right now with my family! We're supposed to check in at 3 PM. Can you book me another room?

**Agent:** We're completely booked tonight. It's a holiday weekend.

**Customer:** This is a major problem. You cancelled my reservation without my permission and now you're telling me you have no rooms?

**Agent:** I didn't personally cancel it. The system shows it was cancelled.

**Customer:** I understand that, but your hotel is responsible. What can you do to fix this?

**Agent:** I mean, you could try other hotels in the area?

**Customer:** We specifically chose your hotel because of the location. Isn't there anything you can do? An upgrade to a suite? Check if there were any no-shows?

**Agent:** All our suites are booked too. And I already told you we're completely full.

**Customer:** Can you check your sister properties or partner hotels nearby?

**Agent:** I guess I could, but that would take a while. We don't usually do that.

**Customer:** I would really appreciate it. We have elderly grandparents with us and we need accommodation.

**Agent:** Hold on... Okay, I called our sister property and they're full too.

**Customer:** Just one sister property? Don't you have multiple locations?

**Agent:** That's the only one in this area.

**Customer:** What about offering some compensation for this mistake?

**Agent:** I can offer you a 10% discount on a future stay.

**Customer:** A 10% discount doesn't help me tonight when I have nowhere to stay with my family!

**Agent:** Well, that's our policy for cancellations.

**Customer:** But I didn't make this cancellation! This is your error!

**Agent:** Like I said, the system shows it was cancelled. Maybe you clicked something by mistake?

**Customer:** I absolutely did not. Can I speak with your manager?

**Agent:** She's not here on weekends.

**Customer:** There's no manager on duty?

**Agent:** Not on Saturday afternoons. She'll be in Monday morning if you want to call back.

**Customer:** This is unbelievable. So you have no solution for me?

**Agent:** I gave you a discount for next time. That's what I can do.
