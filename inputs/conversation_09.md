# Customer Service Conversation - Internet Service Outage

**Agent:** TechConnect support, this is Jason speaking.

**Customer:** Hi Jason, my internet has been down since yesterday morning. I've called three times already and no one has fixed it yet.

**Agent:** Okay, let me pull up your account. What's your account number?

**Customer:** It's TC-449823.

**Agent:** Alright... I see you're at 156 Oak Street?

**Customer:** Yes, that's correct.

**Agent:** And you're calling about an outage?

**Customer:** Yes, my internet has been completely down for over 24 hours. I work from home and this is costing me money.

**Agent:** Did you restart your modem?

**Customer:** Yes, multiple times. The technicians I spoke to yesterday walked me through all the troubleshooting steps. They said they'd send someone out to fix it.

**Agent:** I don't see any notes about that in the system.

**Customer:** What? I spent an hour on the phone yesterday and they definitely said they were scheduling a technician.

**Agent:** Well, there's no record of it. Let me run through the troubleshooting steps with you.

**Customer:** I already did all of that! Can you please just send a technician?

**Agent:** I need to verify the issue first. Can you check if the lights on your modem are blinking?

**Customer:** The power light is solid green, the internet light is off, and the WiFi light is off.

**Agent:** Okay, try unplugging the modem for 30 seconds.

**Customer:** I've done this at least ten times already!

**Agent:** Sir, I need you to do it again so I can document it in the system.

**Customer:** Fine... Okay, I've unplugged it, waited, and plugged it back in. Same thing - internet light stays off.

**Agent:** Hmm, that could indicate a signal issue. Let me check for outages in your area.

**Customer:** The previous agent already checked that. There are no reported outages.

**Agent:** I'm not seeing any outages. It might be your equipment.

**Customer:** The modem is only 6 months old. It's your equipment that you provided.

**Agent:** Equipment can fail at any time. You might need to replace it.

**Customer:** So can you send me a new modem?

**Agent:** We can ship one to you. It will arrive in 5-7 business days.

**Customer:** A week? I can't be without internet for a week! Can I pick one up somewhere?

**Agent:** You could go to one of our retail locations.

**Customer:** Where's the nearest one?

**Agent:** Let me check... Looks like there's one about 40 miles from you.

**Customer:** That's an hour and a half drive! This is ridiculous. Can't you send a technician to check the line?

**Agent:** I can schedule a technician, but the earliest availability is Thursday.

**Customer:** That's five days from now!

**Agent:** We're pretty booked up right now.

**Customer:** This is a critical issue. I run a business from home. Don't you have emergency service?

**Agent:** Emergency service is only for commercial accounts. You have a residential account.

**Customer:** I use it for business! Can't you escalate this?

**Agent:** I can put in a request, but I can't guarantee anything.

**Customer:** What are my options right now?

**Agent:** Well, you can wait for the technician on Thursday, or drive to get a new modem and see if that fixes it.

**Customer:** And if the new modem doesn't fix it?

**Agent:** Then you'll still need to wait for the Thursday appointment.

**Customer:** This is terrible service. I'm losing income because of this.

**Agent:** I understand your frustration, sir.

**Customer:** Can you at least credit my account for the downtime?

**Agent:** You'd need to call our billing department for that. I can give you that number.

**Customer:** Can't you transfer me?

**Agent:** They're closed on Sundays. They're open Monday through Friday, 9 to 5.

**Customer:** Of course they are.
