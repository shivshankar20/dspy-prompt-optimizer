# Customer Service Conversation - Billing Question

**Agent:** Thank you for contacting StreamFlix support. This is Ashley. How may I help you today?

**Customer:** Hi Ashley, I just got charged twice on my credit card for my subscription. Can you explain what happened?

**Agent:** I'm sorry to hear about the duplicate charge. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can you provide the email address associated with your account?

**Customer:** It's [email protected].

**Agent:** Thank you, Michael. Let me pull up your account... Okay, I can see your subscription history. I see a charge for $14.99 on February 1st and another for $14.99 on February 20th. Is that what you're referring to?

**Customer:** Yes, exactly. I thought my subscription was monthly, so why was I charged twice in the same month?

**Agent:** I can explain that. Looking at your account, I can see that you originally signed up on January 20th, so your billing cycle is on the 20th of each month. The February 1st charge appears to be from a separate purchase - you rented the movie "Stellar Voyage" for $14.99.

**Customer:** Oh... I didn't realize rentals were separate charges. I thought everything was included in the subscription.

**Agent:** That's a common confusion. Your $14.99 monthly subscription gives you access to our full streaming library of series and movies marked with the "StreamFlix Original" label. However, newer theatrical releases and premium content are available as individual rentals or purchases. "Stellar Voyage" is a new release that's available for rent.

**Customer:** I see. That makes sense now. But I don't remember renting it. My kids use my account too - they probably rented it.

**Agent:** That could definitely be it. To prevent this in the future, I'd recommend setting up a PIN code for purchases and rentals. Would you like me to help you enable that?

**Customer:** Yes, please. How does that work?

**Agent:** It's simple. I can enable it on my end, and you can set your PIN by going to Account Settings > Parental Controls > Purchase PIN. Once set, anyone trying to rent or purchase content will need to enter the 4-digit PIN you create.

**Customer:** That's perfect. Can you turn that on now?

**Agent:** Absolutely. I've just enabled the Purchase PIN requirement on your account. The next time you log in, you'll be prompted to create your 4-digit PIN. Make sure to choose something your kids won't guess!

**Customer:** Great. And just to confirm - both charges are legitimate then? I don't need a refund?

**Agent:** Correct - both charges are valid. However, I can see that "Stellar Voyage" was only watched for 12 minutes. If it was rented by mistake and you didn't actually watch it, I can process a one-time courtesy refund for the rental.

**Customer:** Really? That would be great. Yeah, we only watched a few minutes before realizing it wasn't what we wanted to see.

**Agent:** No problem at all. I'm processing that refund now... Done! You'll see the $14.99 credit back on your card within 3-5 business days.

**Customer:** Wow, thank you! I wasn't expecting that. You've been very helpful.

**Agent:** You're very welcome, Michael! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**Customer:** No, that's everything. Thanks again!

**Agent:** My pleasure! Enjoy your streaming, and don't forget to set up that PIN. Have a great day!
