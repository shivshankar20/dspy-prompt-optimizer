# Customer Service Conversation - Product Inquiry

**Agent:** Thank you for contacting TechStore support. My name is Sarah. How can I help you today?

**Customer:** Hi Sarah, I'm looking at your website and I'm interested in the UltraBook Pro laptop. Can you tell me more about it?

**Agent:** Absolutely! The UltraBook Pro is one of our most popular models. It features a 15.6-inch 4K display, Intel i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and 512GB SSD storage. It's perfect for both professional work and entertainment. Are you looking for anything specific in a laptop?

**Customer:** That sounds good. I mainly need it for video editing. Will it handle that well?

**Agent:** Yes, definitely! The UltraBook Pro is excellent for video editing. The i7 processor and 16GB RAM can handle most editing software smoothly. Many of our customers use it for creative work. We also offer a model with 32GB RAM if you work with very large 4K video files.

**Customer:** The 16GB should be fine. What's the price?

**Agent:** The UltraBook Pro with 16GB RAM is currently $1,299. We're also running a promotion this week - you'll get a free laptop sleeve and 10% off any accessories when you purchase it.

**Customer:** That's a great deal! Does it come with a warranty?

**Agent:** Yes, it includes a standard 1-year manufacturer warranty covering hardware defects. You can also purchase our extended 3-year protection plan for $149, which covers accidental damage as well.

**Customer:** I'll take the laptop with the extended warranty. How long does shipping take?

**Agent:** Excellent choice! Standard shipping takes 3-5 business days and is free for orders over $500. If you need it sooner, we offer 2-day express shipping for $29.

**Customer:** Standard shipping is fine. Let me go ahead and order it.

**Agent:** Perfect! I can help you complete the order right now, or you can checkout directly on our website. Which would you prefer?

**Customer:** I'll do it on the website. Thanks for all your help!

**Agent:** You're very welcome! If you have any questions during checkout or after receiving your laptop, feel free to reach out. Have a great day!
