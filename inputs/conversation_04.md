# Customer Service Conversation - Return Request

**Agent:** Good morning! Welcome to FashionHub customer service. My name is David. How can I assist you today?

**Customer:** Hi David, I need to return a jacket I ordered last week. It doesn't fit right.

**Agent:** I'd be happy to help you with that return. Can I have your order number, please?

**Customer:** Sure, it's FH-20240218-7734.

**Agent:** Thank you! Let me look that up... I can see you ordered the Classic Denim Jacket in size Medium. What seems to be the issue with the fit?

**Customer:** It's too tight in the shoulders. I probably should have ordered a large.

**Agent:** I understand. Sizing can be tricky with jackets. We offer free returns within 30 days, so you're well within the window. Would you like to exchange it for a large, or would you prefer a refund?

**Customer:** Can I exchange it if you have the large in stock?

**Agent:** Let me check availability... Yes, we do have the Classic Denim Jacket in size Large in stock. I can set up an exchange for you. Here's how it works: I'll send you a prepaid return label via email, and once we receive the medium back, we'll ship out the large at no additional cost.

**Customer:** How long does the whole process take?

**Agent:** Once you ship the medium back, it typically takes 3-5 business days for it to reach our warehouse. We'll process your exchange the same day we receive it, and the large will ship out immediately. So you're looking at roughly 7-10 business days total.

**Customer:** That's a bit long. Is there a faster option?

**Agent:** There is! We have an Advanced Exchange program. I can ship the large to you today, and you'll have 14 days to return the medium. We do place a temporary hold on your card for the value of the new item, which is released once we receive the return. Would you like to do that instead?

**Customer:** Yes, that sounds much better. What's the hold amount?

**Agent:** The jacket is $89, so we'll place an $89 hold. As soon as we confirm receipt of the medium in good condition, that hold will be released automatically - usually within 24 hours.

**Customer:** Okay, let's do that. Same shipping address?

**Agent:** Yes, I have it shipping to 742 Maple Street. Is that still correct?

**Customer:** Yes, that's right.

**Agent:** Perfect! I'm processing the Advanced Exchange now... Done! You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with tracking information for the new jacket and a return label for the medium. The large should arrive in 3-5 business days with standard shipping.

**Customer:** Great! Just to confirm - I have 14 days from when to return the medium?

**Agent:** From today's date. You'll receive the return instructions in your email, along with the prepaid label. Just pack the medium in any box, attach the label, and drop it off at any carrier location.

**Customer:** And it has to be in perfect condition, right?

**Agent:** Yes, unworn with tags attached is preferred. Since you tried it on, that's fine - just make sure it's clean and the tags are still on. As long as it's in resellable condition, you're all set.

**Customer:** Perfect. That's everything I needed. Thanks for your help!

**Agent:** You're very welcome! Enjoy your new jacket, and let us know if the large fits better. Have a wonderful day!
