# Customer Service Conversation - Wrong Item Shipped

**Agent:** Thanks for calling ShopQuick, you've reached Brad. How can I help?

**Customer:** Hi Brad, I received my order yesterday but you sent me the wrong item. I ordered a blue women's sweater size medium, but I received a black men's jacket size large.

**Agent:** Okay, what's your order number?

**Customer:** SQ-88291.

**Agent:** Alright, let me see... Yeah, it says here we shipped you order SQ-88291.

**Customer:** Right, but the item inside is wrong. The label on the package is correct, but the actual item is completely different from what I ordered.

**Agent:** That's strange. Are you sure you didn't order the jacket?

**Customer:** I'm absolutely sure. I can see my order confirmation right here - it clearly shows a blue sweater.

**Agent:** Hmm, well mistakes happen. You'll need to ship it back to us.

**Customer:** Okay, and will you send me the correct item?

**Agent:** Yeah, once we receive the return and verify it, we'll process your order again.

**Customer:** How long will that take?

**Agent:** Returns take 7-10 business days to process once we receive them. Then we'll reship your order, which is another 5-7 business days.

**Customer:** So I'm looking at waiting 3-4 weeks for an item because of your mistake?

**Agent:** Well, that's our standard return process.

**Customer:** But this wasn't my mistake. Can't you ship the correct item now and I'll return the wrong one?

**Agent:** That's not really how we do things. We need to receive the return first.

**Customer:** Is there any way to expedite this since it was your error?

**Agent:** I can't really change the process. You'll have to wait for the return to be processed.

**Customer:** Can you at least send me a prepaid return label?

**Agent:** You'll need to pay for return shipping. We only provide prepaid labels if the item is defective.

**Customer:** But you sent me the wrong item! That's not my fault!

**Agent:** Wrong item and defective item are different categories in our system.

**Customer:** That doesn't make any sense. I shouldn't have to pay to return something I didn't order.

**Agent:** I'm just telling you what the policy is.

**Customer:** Can you make an exception given that this was clearly a warehouse error?

**Agent:** I don't really have the authority to do that.

**Customer:** Then who does?

**Agent:** I guess my supervisor, but she's on another call right now.

**Customer:** Can you transfer me?

**Agent:** She's probably going to tell you the same thing. The policy is pretty clear.

**Customer:** I'd still like to speak with her.

**Agent:** Okay, but the wait time is like 30-45 minutes right now.

**Customer:** Are you serious? I've already been on this call for 10 minutes.

**Agent:** Yeah, we're really busy today. You could also try emailing our support team.

**Customer:** How long does email support take to respond?

**Agent:** Usually 3-5 business days.

**Customer:** This is incredibly frustrating. I just want the item I paid for.

**Agent:** I understand, but I can't really do anything else. Do you want to hold for my supervisor or not?

**Customer:** I'll hold.

**Agent:** Alright, transferring you now.
