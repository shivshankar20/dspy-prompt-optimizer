# Customer Service Conversation - Restaurant Food Quality Complaint

**Agent:** Hello, this is Bella's Kitchen, Casey speaking.

**Customer:** Hi, I just received my delivery order and I need to complain about the quality. This is really unacceptable.

**Agent:** What's wrong with it?

**Customer:** Well, first of all, the pasta is cold. Second, the salad is wilted and looks like it's been sitting out for hours. And third, you completely forgot my garlic bread that I paid for.

**Agent:** What's your order number?

**Customer:** BK-7742.

**Agent:** Okay... Yeah, I see your order. It was delivered 20 minutes ago.

**Customer:** Right, and it arrived cold with missing items.

**Agent:** The pasta might have cooled down during delivery. You can microwave it.

**Customer:** I shouldn't have to microwave food from a restaurant! And what about the wilted salad and missing garlic bread?

**Agent:** The salad is fresh from today. Maybe it got tossed around in transit.

**Customer:** It's brown and slimy. This is not fresh.

**Agent:** I don't know what you want me to do about that.

**Customer:** I want a refund or a replacement. This is not what I paid for.

**Agent:** We don't normally do refunds for delivered orders.

**Customer:** Even when the food is poor quality and items are missing?

**Agent:** You'd have to bring it back to the restaurant for us to see it.

**Customer:** I ordered delivery because I can't come to the restaurant! That's the whole point of delivery!

**Agent:** Well, I can't verify the quality over the phone.

**Customer:** I can send you photos.

**Agent:** We don't really have a way to process photo complaints.

**Customer:** This is absurd. What about my missing garlic bread?

**Agent:** Are you sure you ordered it?

**Customer:** Yes! It's right here on my receipt - $4.50 for garlic bread.

**Agent:** Okay, let me check with the kitchen... They said they made it and put it in the bag.

**Customer:** Well, it's not in my bag. I've checked three times.

**Agent:** Maybe the driver took it? I don't know.

**Customer:** So what are you going to do about it?

**Agent:** I can have the driver bring you garlic bread.

**Customer:** Just the garlic bread? What about the cold pasta and bad salad?

**Agent:** Like I said, you can reheat the pasta. And I can't really do anything about the salad without seeing it.

**Customer:** I paid $35 for this meal and it's inedible!

**Agent:** That seems like an exaggeration. I'm sure it's edible.

**Customer:** Are you seriously arguing with me about the quality of food you haven't seen?

**Agent:** I'm just saying our food is usually fine. We've never had complaints like this before.

**Customer:** I find that hard to believe. Can I speak to a manager?

**Agent:** The manager is busy in the kitchen right now.

**Customer:** Can you get them?

**Agent:** Not really, we're in the middle of dinner rush.

**Customer:** So when can I speak to them?

**Agent:** You could try calling back in like an hour or two?

**Customer:** I want this resolved now!

**Agent:** I don't know what else to tell you. I offered to send the garlic bread.

**Customer:** I don't want the garlic bread anymore! I want a refund for this entire order!

**Agent:** I can ask my manager when they're free, but I'm pretty sure they're going to say the same thing.

**Customer:** Which is what?

**Agent:** That you need to bring the food back for inspection.

**Customer:** This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced.

**Agent:** Look, I'm just following our policies.

**Customer:** Your policies are terrible! I'm never ordering from you again!

**Agent:** That's your choice. Is there anything else?

**Customer:** Yes - I'm leaving a one-star review and reporting this to my credit card company.

**Agent:** Okay. Have a good night.
