# Scoring Evaluation - Conversation 09 (Internet Service Outage)

## Conversation Summary
Customer's internet has been down for 24+ hours, impacting work-from-home business. Previous support calls failed to create ticket. Agent repeats troubleshooting customer already completed, offers poor solutions (wait 5 days or drive 90 minutes), and provides no immediate help.

---

## Dimension Scores

### 1. Professionalism and Courtesy: **3/5** (Satisfactory)
**Justification:** Agent maintains professional tone and uses polite language ("I understand your frustration, sir"). However, professionalism is undermined by failure to acknowledge previous calls, insistence on repeating completed troubleshooting, and inability to provide meaningful help. Professional in tone but not in substance.

### 2. Problem Resolution: **2/5** (Needs Improvement)
**Justification:** No immediate resolution offered. All "solutions" are inadequate: wait 5 days for technician, drive 90 minutes for equipment, or wait a week for shipping. For a customer losing business income with 24+ hour outage, these options are unacceptable. Agent offers to "put in a request" for escalation but can't guarantee anything. Core problem remains unresolved.

### 3. Empathy and Understanding: **2/5** (Needs Improvement)
**Justification:** Agent acknowledges frustration verbally ("I understand your frustration, sir") but actions don't reflect understanding. No appreciation for business impact, income loss, or urgency of 24+ hour outage. Treats emergency situation as routine support call. Doesn't advocate for customer despite critical situation.

### 4. Communication Clarity: **3/5** (Satisfactory)
**Justification:** Information is communicated clearly - timelines, locations, options are all stated explicitly. However, agent fails to communicate why previous support notes are missing or provide clear escalation path. Clear about what can't be done, less clear about what can be done.

### 5. Efficiency and Effectiveness: **1/5** (Poor)
**Justification:** Highly inefficient. Forces customer to repeat troubleshooting already completed with previous agents ("Sir, I need you to do it again so I can document it"). No notes from previous calls despite customer calling three times. Can't access emergency service for business user on residential account. Wastes customer time on redundant steps. Billing department closed on Sundays. Soonest technician appointment is 5 days away.

## Overall Score: **11/25**

**Rating Category:** Satisfactory - Acceptable but needs improvement in multiple areas

### Key Weaknesses:
- No record of previous support calls (system failure)
- Forced repetition of troubleshooting for documentation
- No emergency service options for business use
- Inadequate solutions given severity (5-day wait, 90-minute drive)
- Billing department not accessible when needed

### Critical Failures:
- **Lost support history** - Three previous calls not documented
- **Bureaucratic inefficiency** - Must repeat troubleshooting "for the system"
- **Inappropriate service levels** - Business customer on residential account has no emergency option
- **Poor resource availability** - Nearest retail location 90 minutes away, technician 5 days out
- **Fragmented service** - Can't handle billing issue (separate department, closed Sundays)

### Impact on Customer:
- 24+ hours of downtime already, minimum 5 more days expected
- Loss of business income during outage
- Wasted time repeating troubleshooting steps
- Difficult choices: lose 5 days of work or waste 3 hours driving for equipment that might not fix issue
- Cannot get billing credit when needed (department closed)
- Frustration with service quality

### What Should Have Happened:
1. Acknowledge and apologize for lack of notes from previous calls
2. Accept customer's report of completed troubleshooting steps
3. Recognize urgency given business impact and 24+ hour outage
4. Expedite technician appointment or escalate to emergency service
5. Offer to ship equipment overnight at no charge
6. Provide immediate billing credit for downtime without requiring separate call
7. Create support ticket with clear escalation path
8. Call customer back with updates rather than making them call repeatedly

### Systemic Problems:
- **Knowledge management failure** - Support notes not being recorded
- **Account categorization** - No recognition that residential accounts can be business-critical
- **Service tier rigidity** - No emergency service for paying customers based on account type
- **Resource distribution** - Retail locations too far from customers
- **Department silos** - Billing separate from technical support with limited hours

### Business Impact:
Customer experiencing:
- Income loss (work-from-home business offline)
- Severe service disruption
- Poor support experience across multiple calls
- No urgency from company despite critical situation

Likely outcome:
- Customer switches providers when contract allows
- Negative reviews highlighting poor business support
- Possible legal action for business income loss
- Social media complaints about service quality
